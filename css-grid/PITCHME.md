# CSS Grid

_The layout framework we've been waiting for_

---

## Layout Modes

There are several different _layout modes_ in CSS

* Block
* Inline
* Table
* Positioned
* Flexible box (flexbox)
* Grid

Let's briefly highlight _block layout_

---

## Block layout

The most familiar layout mode

A few major points:

* Vertical layout is impossible
* Horizontal layout with floats

But _why_ is it difficult?

## Block layout

The web was for documents

In documents:

* Vertical layout is determined by content
* Images "float" to the left or right of text

Block mode is excellent... _for documents_
