# Layout Modes

There are different _layout modes_ for different situations in CSS

* Block
* Inline
* Table
* Positioned
* Flexible box (flexbox)
* Grid

I want to briefly highlight _block_ before we move on

# Block layout

This layout mode is what we're most familiar with in CSS

There are a few major points:

* Vertical layout ranges from difficult to impossible
* Horizontal layout is restricted to what you can accomplish with floating
  elements

It's important to understand _why_ layout is difficult in block mode

The web was originally meant for documents and in documents:

* Vertical layout is determined by content
* Images often "float" to the left or right of text

In truth, the basic block model is excellent _for documents_
